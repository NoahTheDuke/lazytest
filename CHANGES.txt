v1.1.2        2010-10-03        Minor reloading enhancement

 * Only touch source files on reloading when absolutely necessary


v1.1.1        2010-10-02        Bugfix release

 * Prevent 'namespace not found' bug by touching source files before
   reloading


v1.1.0        2010-10-02        Improvements for random generators

 Note: due to a configuration error, this version was never deployed.

 * Add lazytest.random/default-test-case-count and
   scaled-test-case-count

 * lazytest.describe/for-any uses the above

 * lazytest.report.nested collapses large groups of test cases with
   the same doc strings, such as randomly-generated tests


v1.0.2        2010-10-01        Bugfix release

 * Fix parsing of ns forms with nested prefix lists


v1.0.1        2010-09-29        Bugfix release

 * Fix missing :require of lazytest.random within lazytest.describe

 * Remove libs from clojure.core/*loaded-libs* when reloading. This is
   manipulating an undocumented core Var, but avoids some unnecessary
   loads caused by (require :reload-all ...). It also seems to avoid
   some load-order issues with `:reload-all`, but I can't find
   consistent test cases.
