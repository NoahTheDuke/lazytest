v1.0.2        2010-10-01        Bugfix release

 * Fix parsing of ns forms with nested prefix lists

v1.0.1        2010-09-29        Bugfix release

 * Fix missing :require of lazytest.random within lazytest.describe

 * Remove libs from clojure.core/*loaded-libs* when reloading. This is
   manipulating an undocumented core Var, but avoids some unnecessary
   loads caused by (require :reload-all ...). It also seems to avoid
   some load-order issues with `:reload-all`, but I can't find
   consistent test cases.
