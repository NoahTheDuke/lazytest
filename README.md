Known Problems
========================================

Reloading some AOT (ahead-of-time) compiled namespaces fails with an
exception like:

    namespace 'foo.bar' not found after loading '/foo/bar'

This may be a Clojure bug; see http://gist.github.com/607161

I believe I have a workaround for this as of Lazytest version 1.1.1.
But if it crops up again, you can fix it by disabling AOT-compilation
or removing the compiled classes directory from the classpath.



Test Examples and Groups
========================

Use the `describe` macro to create a group of tests.  Start the group
with a documentation string.

    (ns examples.readme.groups
      (:use [lazytest.describe :only (describe it)]))

    (describe "This application" ...)

If you put a symbol before (or instead of) the string, the full name
of the Var or Class to which that symbol resolves will be prepended to
the doc string:

    (describe + "with integers" ...)
    ;; resulting doc string is "#'clojure.core/+ with integers"

Within a `describe` group, use the `it` macro to create a single test
example.  Start your example with a documentation string describing
what should happen, followed by an expression to test what you think
should be true.

    (describe + "with integers"
      (it "computes the sum of 1 and 2"
        (= 3 (+ 1 2)))
      (it "computes the sum of 3 and 4"
        (= 7 (+ 3 4))))

Each `it` example may only contain *one* expression, which must return
logical true to indicate the test passed or logical false to indicate
it failed.



Nested Test Groups
========================

Test groups may be nested inside other groups with the `testing`
macro, which has the same syntax as `describe` but does not define a
top-level Var:

    (ns examples.readme.nested
      (:use [lazytest.describe :only (describe it testing)]))

    (describe "Addition"
      (testing "of integers"
        (it "computes small sums"
          (= 3 (+ 1 2)))
        (it "computes large sums"
          (= 7000 (+ 3000 4000))))
      (testing "of floats"
        (it "computes small sums"
          (> 0.00001 (Math/abs (- 0.3 (+ 0.1 0.2)))))
        (it "computes large sums"
          (> 0.00001 (Math/abs (- 3000.0 (+ 1000.0 2000.0)))))))



Constants Shared Among Tests
============================

Inside a `describe` or `testing` group, use the `given` macro to
define constants shared among several tests:

    (ns examples.readme.givens
      (:use [lazytest.describe :only (describe it given)]))

    (describe "The square root of two"
      (given [root (Math/sqrt 2)]
        (it "is less than two"
          (< root 2))
        (it "is more than one"
          (> root 1))))

The syntax of `given` is just like `let`, including destructuring support.

Note: `given` expressions are evaluated *before* contexts (see
below). You cannot use contexts in a `given` expression. Givens really
only work for constant values.



Arbitrary Code in an Example
============================

You can create an example that executes arbitrary code with the
`do-it` macro.  Wrap each assertion expression in the `expect` macro.

    (ns examples.readme.do-it
      (:use [lazytest.describe :only (describe do-it)]
            [lazytest.expect :only (expect)]))

    (describe "Arithmetic"
      (do-it "after printing"
        (expect (= 4 (+ 2 2)))
        (println "Hello, World!")
        (expect (= -1 (- 4 5)))))

The `expect` macro is like `assert` but carries more information about
the failure.  It throws an exception if the expression does not
evaluate to logical true.

If the code inside the `do-it` macro runs to completion without
throwing an exception, the test example is considered to have passed.



Contexts
========

Contexts provide support for executing arbitrary code before, after,
or around test cases and test suites.

Fundamentally, a context is a pair of no-argument functions, called
*setup* and *teardown*.  You can create a context out of two functions
with the `fn-context` function:

    (ns examples.readme.contexts
     (:use [lazytest.describe :only (describe testing it with)]
           [lazytest.context :only (fn-context)]))

    (def my-context
      (fn-context (fn [] (println "This happens during setup"))
                  (fn [] (println "This happens during teardown"))))

A context may be attached (via metadata) to any test case or suite.
To attach contexts to test cases or suites, use the `with` macro,
which takes a vector of contexts as its first argument.  Those
contexts will be attached to each test case or test suite in the body
of `with`.

    (describe "Addition with a context"
      (with [my-context]
        (it "adds small numbers"
          (= 7 (+ 3 4)))
        (it "adds large numbers"
          (= 7000 (+ 3000 4000)))))

If you want the contexts to be executed only once for a group of
tests, simply wrap the body of the `with` macro in a single `testing`
group:

    (describe "Addition with a context"
      (with [my-context]
        (testing "with a nested group"
          (it "adds small numbers"
            (= 7 (+ 3 4)))
          (it "adds large numbers"
            (= 7000 (+ 3000 4000))))))

The `lazytest.context.stub` namespace provides contexts for stubbing
out Vars with alternate definitions.

The `lazytest.context.properties` namespace provides contexts for
setting Java system properties.

Note: Givens and contexts are evaluated at different
times. Expressions in the `given` macro cannot refer to context state.



Simple Before / After Contexts
==============================

You can create simple contexts that just run some code before or after
tests with the `before` and `after` macros.  Each takes a body of
expressions to be run during setup or teardown, respectively.

    (ns examples.readme.before-after
      (use [lazytest.describe :only (describe it with before after)]))

    (describe "Addition with a context"
      (with [(before (println "This happens before each test"))
             (after (println "This happens after each test"))]
        (it "adds small numbers"
          (= 7 (+ 3 4)))
        (it "adds large numbers"
          (= 7000 (+ 3000 4000)))))




Stateful Contexts
=================

Contexts which need to provide state information (for example, a
database connection or an open file) to their tests are called
*stateful* contexts.

A stateful context has a setup function which returns a value.  That
value becomes the "state" of the context and may be retrieved by
calling `deref` (abbreviated `@`) on the context.

The teardown function of a stateful context will be called with the
current state of the context as its argument.

For example, a stateful context might be used to open and close a
database connection:

    (ns examples.readme.stateful-contexts
      (:use [lazytest.context.stateful :only (stateful-fn-context)]
            [lazytest.describe :only (describe using it)]))

    (def database-context
      (stateful-fn-context
        (fn [] ... open & return database connection ...)
        (fn [connection] ... close the connection ...)))

    (describe "My tests with a database"
      (with [database-context]
        (it "can read from the database"
          ... database connection is available as @database-context ...)))

It is also possible to bind a stateful context to a local variable
with the `using` macro.  Like `given`, the `using` macro takes a
vector of name-value pairs, but each value must be a stateful context.
Like `with`, the contexts will be attached to all the tests cases and
or suites within the body of `using`.  The contexts may be
dereferenced by their local names.

    (describe "Square root of two with state"
      (using [root (stateful-fn-context
                     (fn [] (Math/sqrt 2))
                     (fn [x] (println "All done with" x)))]
        (it "is less than 2"
          (> 2 @root))
        (it "is more than 1"
          (< 1 @root))))

The `lazytest.context.file` namespace defines stateful contexts for
creating temporary files and directories.

Note: Givens and contexts are evaluated at different
times. Expressions in the `given` macro cannot refer to context state.



Focusing on Indiviaul Tests and Suites
======================================

The `describe`, `testing`, `it`, and `do-it` macros all take an
optional metadata map immediately after the docstring.

Adding `:focus true` to this map will cause *only* that test/suite to
be run.  Removing it will return to the normal behavior (run all
tests).



Generating Random Test Data
===========================

Use random input data in your tests with the `for-any` macro, which
takes a vector of name-value pairs like `given`, where each value is a
generator function such as those defined in `lazytest.random`.

This part needs better documentation.



Getting Started with Leiningen
==============================

These instructions require JDK 6.

Put the following in your `project.clj` file's `defproject`:

    :dev-dependencies [[com.stuartsierra/lazytest "1.1.2"]]
    :repositories {"stuartsierra-releases" "http://stuartsierra.com/maven2"})

Put your app sources in `src/` and your test sources in `test/`

Then run:

    lein clean
    lein deps
    java -cp "src:test:classes:lib/*:lib/dev/*" lazytest.watch src test

And watch your tests run automatically whenever you save a file.

Type CTRL+C to stop.

To run the tests just once and stop, invoke Java as above with
`lazytest.main` instead of `lazytest.watch`.



Getting Started with Maven
==========================

Put the following in your `pom.xml` file's `<dependencies>` section:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.stuartsierra</groupId>
      <artifactId>lazytest</artifactId>
      <version>1.1.2</version>
    </dependency>

And the following in the `pom.xml` file's `<repositories>` section:

    <repository>
      <id>stuartsierra-releases</id>
      <url>http://stuartsierra.com/maven2</url>
      <releases>
        <enabled>true</enabled>
      </releases>
      <snapshots>
        <enabled>false</enabled>
      </snapshots>
    </repository>

Put your app sources in `src/main/clojure/` and your test sources in `src/test/clojure/`

Then run:

    mvn clojure:repl

And type:

    (use 'lazytest.watch)
    (start ["src"])

And watch your tests run automatically whenever you save a file.

Type CTRL+C to stop.



Lazytest Internals
==================

The smallest unit of testing is a *test case*, which is a function
(see `lazytest.test-case/test-case`).  When the function is called, it
may throw an exception to indicate failure.  If it does not throw an
exception, it is assumed to have passed.  The return value of a test
case is always ignored.  Running a test case may have side effects.
The macros `lazytest.describe/it` and `lazytest.describe/do-it` create
test cases.

Tests cases are organized into *suites*.  A test suite is a function
(see `lazytest.suite/suite`) that returns a *test sequence*.  A test
sequence (see `lazytest.suite/test-seq`) is a sequence, possibly lazy,
of test cases and/or test suites.  Suites, therefore, may be nested
inside other suites, but nothing may be nested inside a test case.
The macros `lazytest.describe/describe` and
`lazytest.describe/testing` create test suites.

A test suite function may NOT have side effects; it is only used to
generate test cases and/or other test suites.

A test *runnner* is responsible for expanding suites (see
`lazytest.suite/expand-suite`) and running test cases (see
`lazytest.test-case/try-test-case`).  It may also provide feedback on
the success of tests as they run.  Two built-in runners are provided,
see `lazytest.runner.console/run-tests` and
`lazytest.runner.debug/run-tests`.

The test runner also returns a sequence of *results*, which are either
*suite results* (see `lazytest.suite/suite-result`) or *test case
results* (see `lazytest.test-case/test-case-result`).  That sequence
of results is passed to a *reporter*, which formats results for
display to the user.  One example reporter is provided, see
`lazytest.report.nested/report`.



Making Emacs Indent Tests Properly
==================================

Put the following in `.emacs`

    (eval-after-load 'clojure-mode
      '(define-clojure-indent
         (describe 'defun)
         (testing 'defun)
         (given 'defun)
         (using 'defun)
         (with 'defun)
         (it 'defun)
         (do-it 'defun)))
